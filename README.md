# Python_Loop_Example

This repository contains simple Python programs I created while learning Python in Class 11. These programs focus on using loops to generate a multiplication table of 5. They were my very first steps into programming with Python.

## ðŸ“– Backstory

While learning Python, one of my classmates asked me to explain the concept of loops. I realized explaining loops over WhatsApp would be time-consuming, so I created a video tutorial and uploaded it to YouTube.
